# stupid-generals
A server that runs generals.io without all the messy bits like the client slug for actually playing the game
# Premise:
Developers like the game, but they like coding bots to play for them even more.
# The current goals in order of priority as of October 28th 2023:
1) Finish the server game code
2) Finish the client game view UI and some basic interaction functions that listen for server events
3) Split this repo in two: server, client
4) Leave the client code in here, public for any developer to clone
5) For a developer to play on the server, they clone the client code and write a bot to play for them
